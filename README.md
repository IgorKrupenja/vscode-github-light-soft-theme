# GitHub Soft Theme

A modern light theme for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/) with lower saturation colors. Designed to be easy on the eyes. Based on [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme). Other sources of inspiration are [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code), [Nord Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huytd.nord-light), [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) and [Vitesse Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.theme-vitesse).

The theme also offers a flatter UI with a uniform white background color for editor, panel and sidebar.

    "jumpy2.checkered_labelFontColor": "#FFFFFF",
    "jumpy2.checkered_labelBackgroundColor": "#5a32a3",
    "jumpy2.checkered_labelBorderColor": "#5a32a3"
  }
},
```

## Customization

To customize this theme, refer to the [color theme documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme). For a detailed list of available color customizations, see [theme color reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color). This allows you to conveniently make minor adjustments to the theme without the need to create and manage your own theme repository.

### Editor syntax highlighting

You can also [customise editor syntax highlighting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_editor-syntax-highlighting). An example:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
  "[GitHub Soft]": {
    "textMateRules": [
      {
        "scope": ["variable.object.property.tsx"],
        "settings": { "foreground": "#ff0000" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Semantic highlighting

[Semantic highlighting](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide) is **disabled** for this theme by default. I found the feature too flashy and distracting. If you want to enable it, add the following to your settings:

```json
"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": true,
```

It can also be enabled per-language if needed, for example:

```json
"[typescript]": {
  "editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": true
},
```
