# Github Light Soft Theme

A light theme for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/) with lower saturation colors. Made specifically to be easy on the eyes. Based on [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme). Other sources of inspiration are [Nord](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcticicestudio.nord-visual-studio-code), [Nord Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=huytd.nord-light) and [Vitesse Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.theme-vitesse).

The theme also offers a flatter UI with a uniform white color for panels and sidebar.
